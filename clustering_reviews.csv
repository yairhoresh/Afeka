tablets,Lenovo Tab M10 HD 10.1” Android Tablet (16GB),"This tablet has major compatibility problems for multiple apps. May be an Android 9 problem. Issues I have encountered. Include: will not run amazon shopping app and my att app, amazon prime video can be unstable, can develop a shopping cart in Tom Thumb app but can not check out, WiFi drops out sometimes. Suspect I will find more issues. Has good potential, but currently is frustrating.","I need a basic android tablet for my business that would take photos quickly and not be sluggish. I was able to easily download the app I needed. Photos are good and takes 1 second or less to capture image. Another cheaper tablet I sent back last week took at least 6 seconds to capture image from time I clicked and resulted in missing the moment and long wait times, something we do not have time for in a busy environment. The only negative I have found is a short charging cable, but those are cheap so not a big deal.","This thing is a pain in the ass to use. The power outlet is on the opposite side from the power button, do if your device is charging, you either have the cord being bent(not good for cord or device), or you hit the power button repeatedly & the device keeps turning off. It doesn't hold a charge for very long & takes forever to charge, do the power cord issue, is a big issue. I really hate my new tablet & I'm super bummed about the waste of money."

The recipient says that this tablet is an excellent price for the features offered, and that the quality is even superior to her older tablet which I inadvertently stepped on and shattered the screen! She absolutely loves everything about it, and says this name brand is reliable, of high quality, and reasonably priced compared to similar name brands offering similar features. A+ in her book!","Exactly as described ,very impressed with packaging"
tablets,"Certified Refurbished Fire HD 8 Tablet (8"" HD Display, 16 GB) - Black","After having an iPad mini for the past four years, I was keen on trying a less expensive tablet. My husband has a Kindle Fire and is pleased, so I decided to give the Amazon tablet a try.

From the moment I unboxed the tablet, I was skeptical. First, there was a blemish on the touch screen. Strike one. Next, the previous owner's Washington Post subscription was still active on the tablet, so I had to delete it off of the device and the cloud. Second, I could not play a game without being told that I had insufficient storage. Finally, the battery drained within an hour, even after a full night of charging.

Suffice to say, I have boxed the tablet up, and it was sent back to Amazon today.",did not come with google play services installed had to download 4 different apks.,"Got this for my husband who has a fear of anything tech: he loves it. I set up Parental Controls to prevent his making a brick out of this and he spends hours playing his favorite card games. Good to handle for his large hands, vibrant display, and endless game options. My experience with refurbs, anything, has been positive and this is no exception. I value my AMZ devices for reading, full-house music quality, and good customer support."
air pumps,Swimline Electric Pump for Inflatables,"If you use as the directions tell you to do, this is an excellent little air pump for the price. From little floats to big ride ons, this worked great. For the smaller floats, I used indoors as instructed. I also used for a huge ride on duck but brought the pump outside and made sure to use in the shade so no overheating. Use the right attachment for the blower and the job will go much quicker. Don’t use for more than 20 minutes at a time or it can over heat and I just let it rest a few minutes in between each float to cool off. Would recommend!","Loud, prone to having hoses detach, but it gets the job done. Saves a lot of lung power and also deflates items thoroughly for easier storage.",I used this last weekend to fill 2 inflatable kayaks and a queen air mattress . The adapters fit perfectly to the inlets. If you have large floating pool toys .... get this.It is faster and quieter then the 20gal air compressor I had been using.
air pumps,2 PCS Medical Grade Rubber Pump Air Blower For Drying Eyelash Extension Glue Adhesive Blowing Dust Ball Air Blaster Cleaning Tools,I used it to blow dust from my back camera before replacing my lens. It got rid of the dust well. And i also use this to dry my eyelashes whether i have falsies or just mascara,Worked as described.,Does the job but with a really annoying squeak
air pumps,"EPAuto 12V DC Portable Air Compressor Pump, Digital Tire Inflator","Ha! I love this little guy.

When I say ""little guy"", I mean that affectionately. I've had a portable tire inflator since, well, I can't remember when, but it's been at least three cars. It was measurably bigger than this one and not nearly as impressive.

I'm a big fan of avoiding gas stations for keeping my tires inflated. Beyond the awkwardness of the pumps, their effectiveness is sometimes sketchy. Now, with today's tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS), you get the reminder if you've gone too long without checking and what more perfect and convenient time to refill tires than on a rested and cool car outside your own front door.

This does everything you would ask of a portable inflator: it's fast, it's efficient and it's quiet. My old inflator sounded as if I was tearing up my driveway when I used it and it probably took twice as long to work.

I saw some questions about the potential lost air while detaching the connecting hose and it seems like the pump may run a little over the stated PSI as protection for that situation. The automatic shut-off when it reaches the pressure you set is a huge boon, as I can rumble around in the trunk or work inside the car without having to constantly monitor the pump.

I can't say much about the carrying bag, it's a silly little thing that's likely to tear over time, but that's meaningless when talking about performance and value. If I had any quibble at all, it would be that I don't seem to be able to shut off the light on the pump. It's not a big deal from a power perspective, just an OCD thing (why have it on in the daytime?).

This is a great purchase at a terrific price.","I purchased this to leave in my trunk for emergencies and the first time I tried to use it, the power/flashlight comes on, I set the PSI I want and the compressor doesn't work at all. I tried switching power sources, verified my vehicle supplies the correct current, turned it on and off again, set the PSI higher than I needed and the compressor motor still never comes on. For a product rated so highly, I can't believe it didn't work even once. I ended up with less air in my tires after the bleed from attaching and detatching the valve. Would not recommend anyone buying this as you can't be sure you will get a working one.

Edit 10/9/2017
I called EPAuto after my issue with the tire pump, but hung up shortly after not being able to reach their support. They called me back a few days later and after a quick discussion, offered to send a brand new unit for free. I didn't get a chance to test it until just recently to inflate my wife's spare tire in her trunk. The manufacturer recommendation for this spare is 60 PSI. It was doing a quick job at it up until around 45 PSI where it slowed down dramatically. It still got the job done eventually so I can't fault it on that.

Pro: This air compressor has one of the best cable management systems compared to those I have used in the past; there are notched to hold the air hose around the unit with additional slots to hold the 12V wire on the leg base. It also comes in zip up travel bag. Setting the desired tire pressure is also very quick as the numbers scroll very rapidly.

Con: Pumping slows down dramatically at higher PSI. The light on the unit also can't be turned off. Not too many negatives as long as this one keeps on working!","I'm a car guy and have dozens of these things. I tend to review stuff I really love or really suck. This I like!
It's heavier than average and feels quality, quieter than most pumps - almost too quiet, as I can't tell its done, love the auto pressure button! I can work on other parts of the car while the tires are inflating. It will stop on your pre-selected PSI. cord wraps up neater than most others and has quick connect clips to keep them snug! Comes with a handy storage bag. (I think I heard someone complain about the quality of the bag) - it is more than adequate and most importantly fits easily. It has a nifty carry handle on top. cord length good, light is a handy feature, easy to read display. Controls are intuitive and your pre-set tire pressure stays as default til u change it. Very little noise and vibration when operating way better than average. Pump time is about average. One new feature for me is the screw on attachment to valve. I was skeptical about this, but at the same time wanted to give it a try. As suspected you can loose 1/2 to 1 psi when disconnecting it. I just add 1 psi to selector - it is still quick and easy to connect and disconnect. I paid full price for this pump. 5 star."
clothing,Feetmat Men's Non Slip Mesh Sneakers Lightweight Breathable Athletic Running Walking Tennis Shoes,"I tested this feetmat men’s athletic shoes on the road and crushed-gravel natural surface trails. The shoe is designed for pavement and does not transition well to other surfaces, limiting your routes to the road or sidewalk. However, its stylish look and design makes it even better for your casual outfits. Its my third day testing it and so far so good love it when I put on with my jogger pants.","I have made the best decision by buying this shoes.This shoes is so comfortable and flexible. I bought this for my work and even working for 15 hours straight , it does not hurt your feet. I am so happy because i made the best decision by buying this shoes. Thanks amazon. I will suggest my friends family to buy this shoes. This shoes is same as shown in the picture and so light . I love it. I want to buy more shoes like this.","I like these simple yet uniquely styled shoes. Usually size 10.5 to 11 depending on the maker. They didn't have 10.5 for this shoe so I tried an 11 and it's at good fit for me. The mesh like texture on the surface looks very high quality and durable for fitness use which is what I plan to use these for. Treadmills, elliptical machines..etc. It's been very comfy and my feet didn't feel sore. I also did not have any sore spots after long extended use periods on these machines. Great buy!"
clothing,Calvin Klein Women's Classic Cashmere Wool Blend Coat,Perfect! I wanted something longer than a peacoat. I’m 5’4” 120 lbs. and I got a size 4. It hits me right at the knee and that’s what you want when you’re short to have the most flattering look. It’s not tight-fitting but it’s got a great silhouette and I can wear a sweater underneath with no problem and still have wiggle room. I could size down for a more snug fit but that’s not what I was going for. Sleeves are lengthy but I love them that way. This can be dressed up or down. It’s so cozy and comfortable. True color in my photo. Super-fast delivery! It’s a classic piece women need in their wardrobe.,"While many of the small details were present in this coat, the quality of the fabric was markedly different from the same coat I purchased in a retail store. The color was also not nearly as rich. I was very disappointed and I returned it.","I loved this coat, but had to return it as the sleeves were just a bit too long--not terrible, but I didn't like the feel of it. Other than this, it is a beautifully constructed coat of high quality details inside and out. It has been years since I have seen a coat of this quality even in an upscale department store setting-- when old school quality was an everyday reality. I am disappointed I had to return it."
clothing,adidas Boys' Tricot Jogger Pant,"My son is 57 inches 70 lbs , this is how they fit. They are a thin for spring wear or good for athletes.","My son only wears track pants or joggers.....everyday! When he opened these, he loved them. The quality is great, a little on the thicker side, which I love. He’s also very thin and these pants still fit him. I may have to go back and order a couple others for him. Definitely recommend for anyone looking comfort, yet stylish pants.","These are the cutest little pants
They look great on my 6 year old boy. Since he is petite i got the Size 4 for Him and they are perfect"
plant seeds,"TickleMe Plant Seeds Packets (2) for Party Bag or Christmas Stocking Stuffer! Leave Fold Together When You Tickle It. Great Science Fun, Green and Educational. Easy to Grow Indoors. It Can Flower.","They were really easy to grow, I used 1 bag and put the seeds into 2 pots. I was worried that they were not going to grow because I didn’t have stable 70-80 degree weather like the page said would be necessary in order to grow the seeds, more like 50-60 degree weather, but to my surprise, around a week or two later I saw little sprouts. Around 3 weeks after the sprouts came up the leaves had grown and I saw a tiny, little tickle me plant. It is really cool to watch it fold up and blows my mind every time. Really loved them! Great, affordable, would totally recommend!",Bought these for my niece and my nephew and kept a few seeds for myself. I am not sure if they have planted their seeds yet but I did. I planted 3 of the seeds and 2 sprouted! They are growing bigger everyday and they have their first set of leaves that you can 'tickle'! Too cute! Very pleased with everything,Awesome.
plant seeds,"Set of 30 Pack Vegetable Seeds! 30 Varieties! Create a Deluxe Garden! All Seeds are Heirloom, 100% Non-GMO! by Black Duck Brand 30 Different Varieties","30 packs but only a dozen different kinds of seeds, NOT ""30 different varieties.""","I was really skeptical about the quality of these seeds, given the price and variety. They contain more seeds per pack than most of those sold for more money at local stores, including the ""big box"" places with garden centers. We planted some in peat cups with potting soil soon after they arrived, and the germination rate was very high. There's an excellent variety of basic garden veggies here. We are quite happy with this purchase!","My bundle was missing a corn, pickle, collards and tomato package that was shown in the picture. Instead, they shipped duplicate packages of parsley and lettuce."
plant seeds,Wildflower Seeds - Premium Flower Seeds Pack [4oz / 18 Variety] Perennial Garden Seeds for Attracting Birds & Butterflies - Flower Seeds for Planting Outdoor,This was the perfect amount for 120 little seed packets that we are giving as favors at our wedding. I put I think 1 tsp of seeds in each packet - perfect amount!,This product is great. The package is very sturdy and attractive. Which made it a nice enough for a gift. I bought this for my mother and she says that there was lots of seed and they began sprouting very quickly. I would definitely buy this product again. It is a great deal and high quality!!,I love how after I ordered these seeds they sent me tips & followups. They were exactly what I was looking for & at a good price. Would buy again!
